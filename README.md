# entershot
super little made-in-5-minutes side-project that i couldn't stop thinking about.

## if you want to use this... thing, well... do this.

first of all:

```git clone https://github.com/matjsilva/entershot.git```

and then:

```cd entershot```<br>
```npm install```

now you can be happy:

```node index```

also, if you are REALLY using this (this is kinda impressive) you can stop the script by pressing Ctrl+' while focusing any other program.
